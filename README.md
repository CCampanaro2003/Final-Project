# Final-Project
This is my final project for my Linux class.
# What's the purpose of this project?
The purpose of my project is to demonstrate my knowledge of using the /bin/bash command.



# What my Final-Project contains:

My project contains a bash script that prints 1 to 50 on the terminal.

The bash command looks like this:


#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..50}; do

  echo"$1"
  
done

To use this command you must type ./myscript.sh then hit enter and the result is that it will print the numbers 1 through 50 on the terminal.
# Addidional Notes

What this project has taught me is how to create a bash script and also how to use GitHub.
